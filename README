This is an interpreter for the OIL register machine. An OIL
(One Instruction Language) machine consists of several registers,
each of which contains an arbitrary-sized integer, and a sequence
of subtract-and-branch-if-zero instructions. Each instruction
takes the form

      sbz x y l

which is equivalent to (in pseudo-C)

           x -= y
           if(x == 0)
              goto l;


I wrote this as a project for Computational Discrete Mathematics
at CMU in December 2010. It's fairly small, but makes good use
of macros to provide a clean programming interfae for an otherwise
extremely obtuse language. Its development also led to the discovery
of a (now fixed) bug in Clojure's basic arithmetic.
